    "# Slurm Simulator Tutorial (version 2024.03)\n",
    "This tutorial is for Slurm Simulator version 3.0, which is based on Slurm-23.02.\n",
    "\n",
    "We support two approaches for Slurm modeling:\n",
    "1) Slurm Simulator is a modified Slurm code allowing time-accelerated simulation.\n",
    "   That is, one month of workload can be done in hours (subject to system size and workload).\n",
    "2) A Virtual Cluster (VC) is a cluster built within Docker in which each compute and head node is modeled by its own container.\n",
    "   The Slurm code is unmodified.\n",
    "   It does not allow time-accelerated simulation; that is, calculating one month's workload would take a month.\n",
    "   VC is largely used by us to calculate reference workload realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches use same format to specify submitted jobs (events file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will concentrate on Slurm Simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some terminology we used and the meaning we place into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workload** describes all compute jobs that HPC resources need to do. It is also referred to as **job traces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workload realization** is a particular way in which the workload was processed by HPC resources. \n",
    "That is, now we know the job starting times and which nodes were used.\n",
    "Due to stochasticity the same workload on the same HPC resource with the same Slurm configuration can have different workload realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Events File** - a file to specify users' jobs and other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start using Slurm Simulator is by using a docker container. \n",
    "The Slurm simulator container contains Slurm simulator binaries and all necessary libraries and tools for \n",
    "running the simulator, analyzing results, and doing full development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Slurm simulator container is built on top of <https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks> with bits from <https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided container has `mariadb` with user account `slurm` and password `slurm`. The password for user `slurm` is `slurm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install proper docker on your System\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at <https://www.docker.com/> for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Slurm Container\n",
    "\n",
    "The username within the container is `slurm`, and the password is also `slurm`. For security reasons, keep the container local or do ssh-port forwarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The container uses port 8888 for Jupyter Lap and 8787 for the RStudio server.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access Jupyter Lab, use the URL provided after launch in output. For RStudio, go to <http://localhost:8787>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Simplest: Just to Try It, Good to Do Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 0.0.0.0:8888:8888 0.0.0.0:8787:8787 -it \\\n",
    "    --name slurmsim -h slurmsim \\\n",
    "    nsimakov/slurm_sim:v3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the shown URL to start Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Actual work: With X11 Forwarding and Directories Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is working on WSL (don't forget to start docker and enable integration with your distros):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 0.0.0.0:8888:8888 0.0.0.0:8787:8787 -it --rm \\\n",
    "    --name slurmsim -h slurmsim \\\n",

    "mkdir -p $HOME/slurm_sim_wsp\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Users Id Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In case if your user-id and group-id is not 1000, then you can add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    -e NB_USER=\"slurm\" \\\n",
    "    -e NB_UID=\"<user id>\" \\\n",

    "    -e NB_GID=\"<group id>\" \\\n",
    "    -e CHOWN_HOME=yes \\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not sure about CHOWN_HOME and keep NB_USER and NB_GROUP default to slurm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the container is built on top of <https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks> it supports some of the docker-stacks magics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Tutorial Files and Starting Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch Jupyter Lab and the terminal window in it. Copy all tutorial files to `/home/slurm/work`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cp -r /opt/slurm_sim_tools/tutorials/* /home/slurm/work/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Get to `/home/slurm/work/micro_cluster` directory and start `micro_cluster_tutorial.ipynb` notebook.\n",
